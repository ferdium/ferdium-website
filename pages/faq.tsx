            Not seeing the menu bar (File, Edit, View, Etc.) might mean that it is hidden, and it

            If you want to prevent it from auto-hiding again, un-tick the option:

            This is because the releases aren&apos;t yet signed. We are still working on getting an
            Apple developer license and a certificate for Windows.

        <FAQEntry title='My Discord service is not showing properly. What should I do?'>
          <>
            This is because of the User Agent within the service. Discord thinks you are on a mobile
            site instead of a desktop site.
            <br />
            It can be solved by right-clicking on the discord service that you are using from the
            sidebar and choosing edit. Scroll down and update the User Agent. A full list of User
            Agents can be found{" "}
